REM Author: Cameron Glass
REM Description: This payload opens a photo booth window and automatically takes a picture. Once this picture is taken, this payload proceeds to open terminal and tell it to say "You look ugly!". This payload is great for friends and family.
REM Credits: I must give all of the credit to Hak5 for their amazing product. This is my first payload and I hope it is a good one!
